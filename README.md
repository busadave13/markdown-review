# Markdown Threads

**Review and comment on markdown files directly in VS Code** — no more switching to Google Docs or losing context in PR comments. Threads are stored alongside your docs in Git and can be published as pull requests with one click.

## ✨ Features

### Core Commenting
- **Inline threaded comments** — Add comments anchored to specific sections of your markdown docs
- **Reply, edit, delete** — Full conversation threading with author controls
- **👍 Reactions** — React to comments with thumbs-up
- **Resolve & reopen** — Mark discussions complete; resolved threads are locked from edits

### Smart Anchoring
- **Survives edits** — Comments stay attached even when you reorganize your document
- **Stale detection** — Get a visual warning when the underlying content has changed
- **Orphan handling** — When you delete a section, comments appear in a dedicated "Orphaned" area with options to reparent them to another section

### Workflow
- **Draft mode** — Comments save locally until you're ready to share
- **One-click PR creation** — Publish all drafts as a pull request to GitHub or Azure DevOps
- **Activity Bar sidebar** — Browse all markdown files in your workspace with comment counts
- **Statistics chart** — See open, resolved, and orphaned thread counts at a glance

### Preview Experience
- **Side-by-side preview** — Rendered markdown with comment sidebar
- **Mermaid diagrams** — Code blocks render as diagrams with theme support
- **Thread counts** — Badges on headings show how many threads are attached

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Right-click** any `.md` file in the Explorer → **"Markdown: Review and Comment"**
2. The preview opens with a comment sidebar on the right
3. Click **💬** on any heading to start a thread
4. When ready, click **Publish** in the sidebar header to create a PR

> **Tip:** The Publish button shows automatically when you have drafts (e.g., "Publish 3 drafts")

## 📁 How Comments Are Stored

Comments live in a `.comments.json` sidecar file next to each document — fully version-controlled:

```
docs/
  feature-x.md
  feature-x.comments.json    ← created automatically
```

This "docs as code" approach means:
- Comments travel with your docs through branches and merges
- Full Git history of all feedback
- No external service dependencies

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `markdownThreads.autoOpenPR` | `true` | Open browser after PR creation |
| `markdownThreads.branchPrefix` | `"doc-comment"` | Prefix for comment branches |
| `markdownThreads.defaultProvider` | `"auto"` | Git provider (`auto`, `github`, `azuredevops`) |

## 🔗 Anchoring & Reparenting

Comments anchor to sections using a smart hybrid approach:
- **Heading slug** — Primary identifier from the heading text
- **Content hash** — Detects when section content changes
- **Line hint** — Helps recover when headings are renamed

**When a heading is renamed**, the extension detects the change and offers a **"Reparent to..."** button to reattach orphaned comments to the correct section.

## 📋 Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0 or later
